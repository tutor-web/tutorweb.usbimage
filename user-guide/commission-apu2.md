1. Screw in the 2 antennae labelled "Front" to the side of the unit nearest the lights, point them upwards
2. Screw in the other 2 antennae into the back of the unit, point them upwards
3. Attach the PSU to the back of the unit to the right
4. It is not generally necessary to attach the serial USB adapter, but if needed it connects to the leftmost port

## Powering on the server

The server should power on automatically when plugged in, if not press the red button on the side of the unit.

A series of 5 high-pitched beeps will indicate it is ready for use.

## Powering off the server

Press the red button on the side of the unit, wait for the lights on the side to go out. The power can now be removed.
